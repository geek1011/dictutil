## dicthtml
These pages are some notes I've made about the Kobo dictionary format based on reverse engineering the firmware and the official dictionaries.

- [Format](./dicthtml/format)
- [Prefixes](./dicthtml/prefixes)
- [v1/v2 dictionaries](./dicthtml/v1v2)

## dictutil
dictutil is a low-level tool to unpack, pack, and perform other operations on Kobo dictzips.

- Coming soon.

## dictgen
dictgen is an easy-to-use tool/library to generate Kobo dictionaries from scratch or use in conversion scripts.

- Coming soon.
